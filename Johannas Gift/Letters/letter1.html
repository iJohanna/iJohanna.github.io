            <div id="letter-desc">
                <p id="b"> August 22, 2021: </p>
                <p>I should drink less water. I think Johanna might find it weird how often I need to drink water. </p>
                <br>
                
                <p id="b"> August 23, 2021: </p>
                <p>I've only known her for 2 1/2 days and I almost cried to her at the dinner table. </p>
                <br/>
                
                <p id="b">August 24, 2021:</p>
                <p>Yesterday, when we played 3, 2, 1, we both laughed so hard when we kept saying ice. This is the nice part of college. Meeting people. Clicking. But I told her today I couldn't eat because I was so worried about my classes. I hate school. But telling someone made me feel better.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">August 28, 2021:</p>
                <p>I told her in the morning that though it was probably too early to say, I'd miss her once she graduated.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">August 31, 2021:</p>
                <p>Truth be told, part of me worries that if Johanna sees me too much she'll get sick of me.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">September 9, 2021:</p>
                <p>I missed her while Afrida, Farzana and I got Afrida's fridge from the mail room.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">September 10, 2021:</p>
                <p>We played superlatives last night. Johanna is most likely to lose touch and I'm most likely to try to keep in touch. I felt weird that I was the obvious choice. Johanna said that I tried the hardest and I began, “Is that …?” As in is that good or bad.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">September 12, 2021:</p>
                <p>Eventually we had to get ready for the carnival. I felt bad for a brief second as they all got dressed up - wearing make up and jewelry and doing things to their hair. It gave me that bad high school prom feeling again. I wish I could tell Johanna about it. Maybe I will some time.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">September 16, 2021:</p>
                <p>Johanna was off the phone and asked what was up. I couldn't wipe the stupid smile off of my face. I think I got more of a high from telling her about the job than I did from reading the email confirmation that I got the job.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">September 19, 2021:</p>
                <p>Friday night, Johanna and I talked till 3AM about space and death and deep sea animals and Copernicus and Ted Kaczynski and the meanest thing we've ever done and family and breaking down, quitting society, and living in the woods.</p>
                <br/>


                <p id="b">September 29, 2021:</p>
                <p>We laughed at the thought of being passive aggressive to worms</p>
                <br/>


                <p id="b">October 1, 2021:</p>
                <p>I made pizza while she worked on her honors thesis.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">October 4, 2021:</p>
                <p>I was crying a little in the rec room after somebody took my favorite study seat. They're gone now. I started taking a walk and asked Johanna to come with. I wanted to sit somewhere. Wanted to tell her about job anxiety and michaels dad and how it's been a year since my moms diagnosis. But all I gave away was when she asked how I was on a scale of 1 to 10 and I said 6 and she gave an impressed “oh!”</p>
                <br/>


                <p id="b">October 12, 2021:</p>
                <p>I want so desperately to stay up till 3 again, just talking to Johanna. I want to tell her more about Saturday and all the time I spent thinking today about whether or not I am a good person.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">October 14, 2021:</p>
                <p>Johanna did, in fact, hear my “Take On Me” alarm.</p>
                <br/>


                <p id="b">October 15, 2021:</p>
                <p>My test was going over time because of technical difficulties. When it finally finished, I opened my door. Opened my mouth to complain about the test, till I realized it was Chaima not Johanna at the sink. For a second, I wondered where she was. Then, laughter from the other room. They were watching squid game in there. I went to the bathroom, then back to my room quietly. I know they must be getting closer while I'm working or in the study room. <br>
                Johanna did make pancakes with me and I was quiet through the whole thing. She thought it was because of the test. I just knew she'd rather be hanging out with Farzana and Afrida. She kept commenting on how much fun they seemed to be having in their room. We kept hearing laughter from there.</p>
                <br/>
                                
    
                <p id="b">October 21, 2021</p>
                <p>She wanted to come down but rethought it because she didn't want to bother me. I wished she would bother me.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">October 22, 2021:</p>
                <p> She said, “If you don't mind me asking …” and I smiled in the dark. There's not much I would mind her asking. She asked if I found comfort in prayer and I said yes, if I did it right.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">October 24, 2021:</p>
                <p>We ate pizza - I ate mine cold which she detested. We watched bake off, fuming that Freya went home. We only got a few more puzzle pieces in. We ate birthday cake off a shared plate. It occurred to me at a point that I was really lucky, sitting next to someone I like, watching a show that relaxes me, eating cake and doing a puzzle. She won't be here in a year. It won't always be like this.</p>
                <br/>

                <p id="b">October 25, 2021:</p>
                <p>She asked if I was warm enough at night and offered me her duvet which I thought was really sweet, but declined because it felt too big an offer. <br>
                At around 1:30, the fire alarm went off. She wrapped her blanket around her. Every time we go out during a fire drill, it is exceptionally cold. But this time, she extended her blanket and hugged me for a while. Felt better. When we got back in, she offered me her duvet again. <br>
                I took a nap till 11:45pm. I ate breakfast at the table where she worked. She showed me the email her professor sent out to the whole class where she got a special shout-out for having done so well on the midterm. Happy for her. Proud of her. She asked me again if I'd been cold last night.</p>
                <br/>
    
                <p id="b">October 26, 2021:</p>
                <p>We just kept laughing. “I'm a senior and you're nothing.” “Are you a clanner?” “This anxiety is eating me out.” </p>

                <p>At some point in the summer, I thought about how we didn't have a conception of each other's lives anymore. I didn't really know what you were up to in Tanzania or Seattle and you didn't really know what I was up to either. We didn't text much and whenever we did, it was patchy and felt awkward to me. I wasn't going to text you at first when I got the news that my mom was off of chemotherapy because it just seemed like too sudden thing of a thing to say. Even before I found out the doctors had stopped her treatment, I knew she would be dying soon. I would lie in bed and try to think about what kind of person I would be once it happened.</p>
                <p>That is partly what I was thinking about in the two hours between when I woke up and when you woke up the morning after I slept over at your place. That is why I asked if you felt like you had changed fundamentally as a person after this past summer (or well, my specific wording was if you felt like your fundamental fears and desires had changed). I thought that maybe you had, considering all the new things you'd done, new places you'd been to, and new people you'd met. I couldn't decide if you felt like a different person to me. I couldn't decide if I felt like a different person either. The answer might change depending on what day I am asked, but that morning when I woke up in your bed, I would have said that I do. </p>
                <p>I am thinking about the night we stayed up till about 4AM on my bed. My bed was still high then. At one point, we began scrolling through our phones to show each other old photos. I remember feeling close to you. I still remember some of the photos and the names of your friends. Emma. Elaine. The French guy. The suitcase you guys slid down. The Ship of Theseus. Watching Game of Thrones. Throwing up on the floor of your room. Staying up till dawn so you wouldn't have to say goodbye. </p>
	            <p>You know, initially I was going to make this a letter about the future. I was going to write about where we would be five or ten years from now. But I think that perhaps we have wrung that subject dry. I used to have a very different picture of what my future would be like. In the 11th grade, I wanted to move to Tennessee in the future. I don't know if I've ever told you that. I was hard set on specifically Tennessee. There were superficial reasons - a musician I loved lived in Tennessee and I had always craved the quietness the midwest in general might offer me. But more than that, I think I clung to Tennessee to give concreteness to my desires. If I just told people I wanted to live in a small house, alone for many miles, it would seem like a nice but feeble sentiment. Just a dream. But if I told people I wanted to move to Tennessee, I would be giving the dream a body, giving it legs to stand on. Because surely nobody just says they want to move to Tennessee without meaning it. I am not really going anywhere with this. I am just rambling. </p>
                <p> You were still asleep next to me. So I looked carefully at the objects around your room and tried to imagine what each one might mean to you - if a book on a shelf was one you loved or had never read, at what point in your life you hung up certain photos, and what person had given them to you. </p>
                <p>I liked flipping through your old journal and seeing what your handwriting used to be like and how you had decided to spell certain words. I feel the same as I did that night when you sat next to me on my ridiculously high bed - I feel like I know you better when I know what you used to be like. Here are things I remember about your past:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You took ballet. Timothee Chalamet's mom was your ballet teacher.</li>

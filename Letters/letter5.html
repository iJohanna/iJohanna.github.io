                <p>About 10% of this website was coded 2 weeks ago. The other 90% was done in the last 24 hours (specifically 3:30pm onwards which is when I got home today - Thursday the 27th). This is slightly upsetting to me because I had much grander ideas for the site. I had a lot of work these past two weeks though. For the past couple of nights I've been going to bed at around 5AM and still waking up at 9AM for class or work. I still have a ton of work left, but I wanted to spend the day relaxing by making this instead.</p>
                <p>So yeah, I had much grander visions. I'll tell you what I wanted to do. Right now, the website is written in vanilla Javascript (and HTML/CSS), but I wanted to make it something called a MERN stack application. It would be overkill for a small site like this that has close to no functionality, but despite the effort and the fact that you wouldn't even be able to tell, I wanted to do it for the very sake that it would be better. And I think you deserve better even if you don't know what better is!</p>
                <p>I was going to write 10 password-protected letters. I was going to explore some python libraries that make it easier to send automated emails so that you would recieve the passwords at different points in the future. I was going to read you stories that I'd written. I was going to make my own animations for the videos. Right now, the login page is basically a joke. Which is fine considering this is not a real website, but I wanted to make this a MERN stack application partly to set up a real user registration system. I knew it wouldn't make a difference to you, but I wanted to do it anyway.</p>
                <p>I was going to finish setting up the lemur site prototype (the working name is “Lemur Learner”) - I designed the icons, the logo, and the header for that site myself and I was going to do the same for this site. </p>
                <p>This site doesn't have any functionality. The user (which is just you) is unable to create, search, or delete anything. The user simply clicks around and receives information. It is very boring. It might as well have all been a text document! And so I wanted to give the user something to do. </p>
                <p>The only way I have been able to carry out part of that goal is to give you a game to play. It was not as technologically challenging of a goal as I would have liked, considering I wrote it in a 2D python game engine meant for wains (I am supposed to, however, become familiar with the Unity game engine soon for a class that I am taking. That is a legit game engine, so perhaps I will make cooler games for you in the future). </p>
                <p>And even when I did decide to write it using the less impressive game engine, I realized it would take far too long to make the game that I wanted to make after I had already made some of the design features. I  decided to build off of an old game instead. Each level would give you a password corresponding to one of the letters. If you clicked on one of the letter cards, it was supposed to open a modal to prompt you for the password and only then would you be allowed to read it. I added in some buttons, home screen, new levels, etc. And so I did all that and then … I forgot to save it! So that is why you just have a C-tier game to play. It's a game I taught one of the nine-year-olds I teach how to make. Once the game didn't save, I didn't bother implementing the letter-password system because it was already getting quite late.</p>
                <p>EDIT FROM OCTOBER 30th: Since I was not able to give this to you by your birthday, I tried my hand this morning at making another game. But it is taking a while, so I will not finish it. But here is the very unfinished game:</p>
                <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/753506357/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p> It was made on Scratch which is another coding website meant for wains.</p>
                <p>This all was obviously not doable anyway considering I thought of the idea exactly two weeks ago. Even early on, I knew I was just letting my imagination run wild and that I absolutely would not do over half the things I was thinking of. </p>
                <p>But I am somewhat glad that I didn't do everything on that list! Not because I no longer think you deserve a real user registration system or automated emails. More so because I had been wondering what I would have left to give you in the future. I am not able to create very many things and I do not have many more ways of telling you that I love you. But now that I haven't done everything, I still have things left to offer. </p>
                <p>So even though I didn't do everything on my list, I want you to know how much I <i>wanted</i> to do. God, an entire backend user registration system for just one person - could you imagine? That is how much I like you! I like you enough to consider setting up an entire server to register ONLY you as a user!!!</p>
                <p>Well setting up a server is not technically very difficult anyway I guess. But still. My point stands.</p>

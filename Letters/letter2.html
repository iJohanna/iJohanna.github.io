                <p>The title makes it sound more salacious than it really is. The secret is rather mundane. Sorry. It's not something I deliberately kept from you. </p>
                <p>Well. At first, I did deliberately keep it from you, but then it just became unimportant. I never thought to bring it up. But I am bringing it up now. </p>
                <p>At the end of the fall semester last year, I wrote you a letter. It was about a page long typed out. I went to print it out in Douglass the day before we all left for home. I kept it next to me as I spent the day studying in the hand hall classroom. </p>
                <p>This letter, of course, never got to you. You seemed upset that day - potentially even upset at me. The timing didn't seem right so I didn't give it to you. That's all it was. This is part of the secret - that I had written you a letter at all. The other secret is what I said in it. </p>
                <p>I can't tell you exactly what I said in it though. Not because I don't want to, but because the physical letter ended up in the trash can of the classroom right before I went back to our room for the night. And the copy on my google drive is deleted too. And so the exact words I had thought to use that day will remain a mystery. </p>
                <p>I do, however, remember the general message I was trying to convey. Some time that week, we had been talking about family dynamics and we concluded that our families communicated in very different ways. </p>
                <p>I kept thinking about it. I think you are closer to your family than I am to mine. In my memory, I have never felt close to my family. It was never a point of tension for me though. We interacted less than the average family, which I considered merely different from and not worse than how families tend to interact. </p>
                <p>I stopped feeling that way in the fall. I changed my mind. I thought it was worse. </p>
                <p>And it was you who changed my mind. </p>
                <p>I had never lived with people besides my family. I had never experienced what it would be like to be close with the people that live with you. But we would make dinner next to each other and then talk about our day at the table. We would say good night to each other. Sometimes, you would make me tea. Sometimes, I would give you snacks. If you were going somewhere, I would see you off at the door. </p>
                <p>It was different to me. If I am being honest, you potentially seeming upset at me was only part of the reason I didn't give you the letter. The other part was this: this was all new to me, but I knew it wasn't new to you. </p>
                <p>You would talk about how you and your brother would put on face masks together and how you'd all huddle around the computer to watch a movie. You would play the 3, 2, 1 game with your dad. I heard the way you'd talk to them when you were on the phone with them - like they were friends of yours. </p>
                <p>You were already close with the people you lived with. And I had this worry that you would think I was being unnecessarily sentimental, that everything I was going on about would read as silly to you. It doesn't matter as much to me now if it does. I didn't realize I wanted to be close to my family till I met you. And I didn't know how to describe the way I viewed you. You were not just a friend to me. But I also did not see you as a sister, necessarily. I just knew that being around you felt vaguely familial to me. </p>
                <p>And ultimately, I think that is a large part of why I appreciate my time as your roommate. I had unlocked a new desire. That is the secret. </p>

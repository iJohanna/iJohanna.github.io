                <p>During the first few months of the fall 2021 semester, I was not sure if we were roommates or if we were friends. It didn't feel like something I could just ask so I didn't. </p>
                <p>A few days after your birthday party, you told me that you thought of me as a friend. It felt like a small weight was taken off of my shoulders. I remember going to bed feeling happy.<p>
                <p>The day after, I felt dread. I do not think I have shared this thought with you before. But ever since middle school, I have thought of myself as someone who is good at making friends, but not necessarily keeping them. When friends would go to other schools, I'd lose touch with them. Even friends that I made out of school didn't last very long. Even when we got along really well. And despite knowing friends from my high school friend group for years even before we all even got to high school, I still didn't feel very close to them. </p>
                <p>And now that the two of us had confirmed that we were friends, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. I was worried that after a certain point, things with you would sour the way it had with some of my old friends. There is no real point in telling you this other than the fact that in my ideal world, every thought of mine would be out in the open. </p>
                <p>My friendship with you means a lot to me. If anything, I think that is why I was worried - I wanted to be your friend, but having you as a friend opened up the possibility of losing you as a friend. But now, I think that even if that does happen, I'd still be glad to have met you. </p>
                <p>That said, I am glad we are still friends. And I hope we stay friends too.</p>

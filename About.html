            Because I wanted to make something for you. Initially, I wanted to knit you something, but I knew my workmanship would be poor. I can't knit, I can't draw, I can't woodwork. And so on and so forth. But I can make a website! <br/> <br/>
            
            If you poke around some more, you will find letters (because I can write), a game (because I can make games - although something did go wrong with the game. You'll read about it in one of the letters), and bedtime story videos (because I can make videos). <br/> <br/>

            This is a small site. And technically, my workmanship here is shoddy as well. There is not much to do, but I hope you like it anyway.

            Happy birthday, Johanna.
